 ### - What is music?
 Among other elements, music is composed mainly for:
 - **Melody**: A series of notes sounding in succession
 - **Harmony**: Notes that are played together at the same time to create a chord
 - **Rhythm**: The arrangement of sounds and silences in time
 
 ### - Musical Scores
 The score is made of staffs that are composed by 5 lines and 4 spaces\
 Is be in this spaces and lines that the notes will be positioned\
 To know the position of them, the clefs are used.
 One of the most commom clefs is the G, that will be used in this playground.
 With G clef, the G note will be positioned in ( from bottom to top ) second line
