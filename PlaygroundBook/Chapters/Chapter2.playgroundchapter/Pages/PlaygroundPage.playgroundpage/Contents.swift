 # How use this page
 
 1. Find a flat place moving the iPad around your environment until it draws a plaid plane
 
 2. When the plane appears, tap on the plane to add the xylophone, the staff and the score.
 
 ## If you tap and the xylophon don't appear and the staff do, you can press reset to try again.
 
 ## If you return to first page, you will have to configure it again
 
 3. If there is some problem with your xylophone you can press the *reset* button on left-top side
 
 4. If you need to configure the position, size or rotation there will be an edit button in the right-top corner
 - To *edit position*:
 * Press the position button
 * Move to the place you want
 * Press the done button in right-top corner
 - To *edit size*:
 * Press the resize button
 * Use two fingers to resize
 * Press the done button in right-top corner
 - To edit *rotation*:
